# ❤️‍🩹 Heart Disease Dataset Analysis - Visual Insights in Healthcare

This project explores a **heart disease dataset** to identify trends in age, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and heart disease prevalence. It leverages Python's data science stack to visualize and better understand the data.

## 📌 Features

- Dataset overview and summary statistics
- Unique value counts in gender and smoking status
- Missing value analysis with suggestions for imputation strategies
- Visualizations:
  - 📊 Histogram of Age Distribution
  - 📊 Bar Chart for Heart Disease Status (Yes/No)
  - 📦 Box Plot for Cholesterol Levels

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – Data manipulation
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – Visualization
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – High-level data visualization

## 📈 Insights

- Distribution of age among patients
- Frequency of heart disease cases vs non-cases
- Outlier detection in cholesterol levels
- Preliminary groundwork for health-related predictive modeling

## 🚫 Missing Data Handling

The script highlights missing values column-wise and suggests proper methods (mean, median, or mode) for dealing with them depending on the data type and distribution.
